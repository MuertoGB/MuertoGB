**Hello human** ğŸ‘‹

Apologies for the lack of updates recenty, I am extremely busy with my personal life. Rest assured updates to Mac EFI Toolkit will arrive later this year.

Allow me to introduce myself, David (Muerto), a business-to-business technician specializing in micro-soldering and Mac logic board repair.

I am a strong supporter of the right to repair movement and firmly believe in empowering individuals to take control of their electronic devices ğŸ’». To that end, I develop tools for various platforms that are specifically designed to assist in the repair of your technology.
